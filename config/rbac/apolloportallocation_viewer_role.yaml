# This rule is not used by the project apollo-network-controller itself.
# It is provided to allow the cluster admin to help manage permissions for users.
#
# Grants read-only access to network.apollo.network resources.
# This role is intended for users who need visibility into these resources
# without permissions to modify them. It is ideal for monitoring purposes and limited-access viewing.
